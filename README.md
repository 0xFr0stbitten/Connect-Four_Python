# Connect-Four_Python

This is the "Board" class for Connect Four using Python 3. Just something I did in class and I thought I'd tweak and share. This class initializes the board of the game (creates visual for board), checkers (X or O), and win conditions (4 checkers in a row horizontally, diagonally, or vertically).
